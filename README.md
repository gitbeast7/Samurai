# Installation and Usage
The application is a Windows 64-bit executable.

Note: If you're only using the application you can simply drop the executable wherever you like.
A single .xml file will be created the first time you run the application. This simply stores configuration
parameter values so subsequent launches will be initialized to the last user settings.
If the configuration file is removed or can't be written a default configuration is used on each launch.
